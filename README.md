# Urban Species Diversity during India's COVID-19 Lockdown

This repository holds data and code for the paper [Ruling the Roost: Avian Species Reclaim UrbanHabitat During Indiaâ€™s COVID-19 Lockdown](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.422890v1), joint with Sumeet Gulati. To replicate our paper, simply:

1. Download the data from the "data/final" folder
2. Run the R script in "scripts/R/paper_figs". This script reproduces summary figures, tables, and empirical estimates in the main text and supplementary material of our paper.
3. To replicate the species-level analysis, and marginal species plots, run the R script in "sripts/R/species_distbn.R"

Note that you will have to adjust the directory paths for your local machine.
